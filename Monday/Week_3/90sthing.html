            So, we've all heard of what a game is, or perhaps even seen a game.
            After all, they're the hottest things around!
        </p>

    <p>
        Let's take a look at what you <i>could</i> be doing! <br>

            Then Final Fantasy VII is for you! (That's Final Fantasy <i>Seven</i> for you illiterates).</div>

        Perhaps that's not really your speed...that's ok!
        There are <b>PLENTY</b> of games out there! Maybe you're one of those people that think to yourself:<br>
        "Why hasn't anyone made a game where I can be a block of cheese that runs from ghosts?"<br>
        <b>GUESS WHAT!?</b> <br>

            The dream comes true in PAC MAN (Or PAC Woman...obviously)</a> <br>
        That's right, you're a block of cheese that runs from ghosts <i>AND</i> while
        eating...uh...little...white...orbs(?)
    </div>
    <div>
        Oh, still not sold <b>huh!?</b>
        I know, you're thinking "Pfft, that's not a plumber annihilating creatures by jumping on their head, though!"
        <br>
        And you're right. A proactive block of cheese is certainly not that...<b>however!</b> <br>

        Mr.Mario, here, has MASTERED the art of sending enemies to oblivion via head stomps.</a> <br>
        <div font-size="10px">
            (Let's be honest, though, there's little that would really shrug off a head stomp) <br>

            What's that? I like my games like I like my life, you say? Hm. <br>

            I mean, if you're really into that kind of thing...<br>
